                        <p>Kabul, Persian Kabol ,  capital and largest city of Afghanistan. It lies along the Kabul River at an elevation of about 5,900 feet (1,800 metres) in the east-central part of the country. The nations cultural and economic centre, the city lies in a triangular valley between the two steep Asmai and Sherdawaza mountain ranges. Roads connect it with most other areas of Afghanistan, with Uzbekistan to the north, and with Pakistan to the east.</p>
                        <p>Kabul has existed for some 3,500 years. It is mentioned in the Rigveda (collection of Indian sacred hymns; c. 1500 bce), and Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer, geographer, and mathematician, knew of it in the 2nd century ce. The city owes its long preeminence to its location commanding the passes from the north through the mountains of the Hindu Kush and from the south through the towns of Ghazni and Gardeyz (Gardez). It also commands the main approaches through the Khyber Pass to Pakistan and India. Kabul first became a regional seat of government in the 8th century. In the 13th century the Mongol invader Genghis Khan inflicted considerable damage on the city. Kabul was the capital (1504 to 26) of the Mughal dynasty, under Babur, and it remained under Mughal rule until 1738, when Nadir Shah of Iran took it. </p>

                        <p>Mazar-e Sharif, city, northern Afghanistan, 35 miles (56 km) south of the border with Uzbekistan, at an elevation of 1,250 feet (380 metres). The town derives its name (meaning &ldquo; tomb of the saint &rdquo; ) from the reputed discovery there of the tomb of the caliph ?Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, in the 15th or (according to Afghan legend) 12th century. A blue-tiled mosque and a shrine mark the location of the tomb, which is venerated by all Muslims, especially the Shi?ites. Mazar-e Sharif&rsquo;s growth and the corresponding decline of the much older town of Balkh, a few miles to the west, date from this discovery. Mazar-e Sharif came under Afghan rule in 1852 and became the political hub of Afghan Turkistan in 1869. After their military intervention in 1979, Soviet forces established a military command in the town. It was later the site of brutal fighting and atrocities between competing Afghan factions and changed hands several times. The city was controlled by the Taliban from 1998 to late 2001, when it was taken with little violence by a coalition of Afghan, U.S., and allied forces; a subsequent uprising at a prison there holding Taliban troops and their allies, however, left hundreds dead.</p>
                        <p>Mazar-e Sharif is located in one of Afghanistan&rsquo;s most fertile regions, extensively irrigated by the Balkh River and producing cotton, grain, and fruit. The town&rsquo;s industries include flour milling and the manufacturing of silk and cotton textiles. It is connected by road and air with Kabul, 200 miles (320 km) southeast, and other Afghan cities and is the country&rsquo;s chief transit point for Central Asian trade. A well-known Islamic theology school is located there. The inhabitants of Mazar-e Sharif are mainly Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Turkmens. Pop. </p>

                        <p>Kandahar, also spelled Qandahar,A?mad Shah Durrani: tombs of children in Kandahar city in south-central Afghanistan. It lies on a plain next to the Tarnak River, at an elevation of about 3,300 feet (1,000 metres). It is southern Afghanistan&rsquo;s chief commercial centre and is situated at the junction of highways from Kabul, Herat, and Quetta (Pakistan). Kandahar has an international airport, though it has traditionally been used for domestic flights.</p>
                        <p>The strategic and commercial importance of the site, on main routes via Herat to Central Asia, to Kabul, and to India, explains its long history of conquests and frequent refoundings. The city was included in the Achaemenian dynasty by Darius I, was taken by Alexander the Great in 329 bc, was surrendered by Seleucus I (Nicator) to Chandragupta in 305 bc and dignified by a rock inscription in Greek and Aramaic by his grandson Ashoka, and thereafter was successively held by Greco-Bactrians, Parthians, Sakas, Kushans, and Sasanians. During its Islamic period, Kandahar was held by a succession of various Arab, Persian, Turkic, and Mongol overlords. It fell under Arab rule in the 7th century ad, under the ?affarid dynasty in the 9th, and under the Ghaznavid dynasty in the 10th. Kandahar was destroyed by the Mongol invader Genghis Khan and again by the Turkic conqueror Timur (Tamerlane), after which it was held by the Mughal dynasty (16th century) and the Persians (17th century). In 1747 it became the first capital of a unified Afghanistan. From 1839 the British sought control of the area but finally lost it in September 1881. The subsequent history of Kandahar has been no less eventful; in the 1980s, during the Afghan War, Kandahar was the scene of intermittent fierce fighting between Afghan rebels and Soviet invasion forces. From the mid-1990s until its overthrow in 2001 the Taliban, an Islamic fundamentalist faction that controlled much of Afghanistan, had its headquarters there. Afterward it was a staging area for U.S. military strikes against Islamic militants. </p>
